**scFlowKit** is a modular and extensible toolkit written in R for streamlined single-cell RNA-seq analysis.

Designed to support both **standard pipelines** and **customizable workflows**, it allows bioinformatics researchers to rapidly process, integrate, and visualize scRNA-seq data.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features

- Compatible with both **Seurat** and **SingleCellExperiment** objects
- Includes powerful general-purpose function `read_sce()` to read `.h5`, `.mtx`, `.loom`, and `.h5ad` formats
- Integrated modules for:
  - Quality control
  - Batch correction
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Clustering & annotation
  - Visualization
- Structured annotation and CLI prompts for usability

### ðŸ“¦ Use Cases

- Rapid startup for scRNA-seq project prototyping
- Teaching material for reproducible single-cell workflows
- Integration with other downstream analysis frameworks

> scFlowKit is actively maintained and aims to bridge the gap between flexible scripting and reproducible workflows in single-cell transcriptomics.
