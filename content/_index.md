        Pharmacy graduate with expertise in bioinformatics and computational biology. I focus on drug target discovery, biomarker identification, and multi-omics data analysis.

        My work spans clinical pharmacology research, single-cell RNA-seq analysis, and development of open-source bioinformatics tools. I write about bioinformatics workflows, data visualization, and academic productivity on my blog [Cell by Cell](https://blog.evanzhou.org).

        Open to collaborative research projects and bioinformatics initiatives.
